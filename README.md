Quantifying dispersity in size and shapes of nanoparticles from small-angle scattering data using machine learning based CREASE
=======================================================================================================================================

Brief Description  
----------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains Python scripts for the implementation of the CREASE genetic algorithm (CREASE-GA) to quantify the dispersity in both size and shapes of nanoparticles using their azimuthally averaged (1D) scattering profiles. The machine learning based CREASE method has the capability to identify the size and shape distributions of nanoparticles even from featureless 1D scattering profiles which have traditionally posed a challenge for analysis with analytical models. The previous implementations of CREASE-GA (2019-2023) for analyzing 1D scattering profiles can be found on the [crease_ga](https://github.com/arthijayaraman-lab/crease_ga) Github page. To interpret the structural information of soft materials from their 2D scattering profiles visit the [CREASE-2D](https://github.com/arthijayaraman-lab/CREASE-2D) Github page.
